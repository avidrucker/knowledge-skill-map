# Knowledge And Skill Maps

## What They Are:

A knowledge and skills map is a structured, visual representation of what someone needs to know, understand, or be able to do within a certain subject area. It breaks down a domain (like learning a programming language, a field of science, or a course's curriculum) into concepts, skills, and related supporting facts or tasks. Typically, it starts at a high-level topic and branches into subtopics, assertions, questions, and actionable tasks. Each node in the map represents a piece of knowledge, a skill, or a resource. The result is a “map” showing how various ideas connect, how foundational concepts support advanced ones, and what steps or tasks learners can follow to build their expertise.

## How to Create One from Scratch:

1. Identify the High-Level Topic:
    Begin by stating the main subject area. For example, "Machine Learning Fundamentals" or "Introductory Machine Learning Course Content."

2. Break Down Major Topics:
    From the main subject, list the key areas or modules. These are the "big picture" concepts. In the C++ example, the top-level concept is "C++ skills," which then branches out into writing the first program, tooling, compilation, and execution.

3. Add Subtopics and Assertions:
    For each major topic, break it down into smaller subtopics or more granular concepts. These might be techniques, methods, theories, or tools. Under each subtopic, include:

    - Topics or Concepts (usually represented as “topics” nodes): For theoretical ideas like "Logistic Regression" or "Decision Trees."
    - Assertions or Facts: Statements that clarify what is true about a concept. For example, "C++ is a compiled language" is an assertion.
    - Skills or Actionables (tasks): Things the learner should be able to do, such as "Train a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn."
    - Questions: Gaps in knowledge or common confusions (optional).
    - Blockers: Issues the learner might face or need to resolve (optional).

4. Organize Hierarchically:
    The map should show a hierarchy from the more general to the more specific. Place foundational concepts near the root and more advanced or detailed items as branches off of these concepts. For instance, under "Linear Regression," you might have "Metrics of linear regression" as a subtopic.

5. Use Clear Labels and Connections:
    Each node should have a clear label. Use indentation or arrows to show relationships. A parent topic leads to child subtopics or skills.

6. Iterate and Refine:
    Once your map is sketched out, review it. Is there a logical flow from basic concepts to advanced? Are the main topics comprehensive but not redundant? Adjust as needed.
